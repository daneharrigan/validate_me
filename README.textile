h1. validates_helpers (in jQuery)

h2. The Plan

It's still an idea of mine that I'm trying to execute. Definitely not complete, but I'm attempting to model HTML form validation off of Ruby on Rails model data validating methods.

h2. The Syntax

This is how I'm structuring things:

h3. Required fields

@
$.validates_presence_of('first_name');
$.validates_presence_of('age');

// or

$.validates_presence_of('first_name','age');
@

h3. Numbers

@ $.validates_numericality_of('age', { on: ['submit','keyup'], greater_than: 3, less_than: 6 }); @
